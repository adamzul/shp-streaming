# Contributing

Before I get any unwanted *complaint* I'd like to make clear the way I develop this library: **I DO NOT accept pull requests**.

This library is actually part of something bigger that I cannot release, so please take it as it comes. As far as I know, this is the only open source and free library currently maintained and PHP 7 compatible to read all kinds of ESRI Shapefiles.
My mission is to provide the best code I am capable of and you get a library which is used everyday in a production environment on *thousands* of real-world use cases.

Accepting a pull request makes things technically complicated for me too: the main repository is not the public one and only the final code get pushed to it. 90% of times the code has already undergone extensive tests and production use before being released here.

Long story short, please feel free to suggest any feature and/or report a bug, I will appreciate it. But let me write all the code, it's even less work for you! :)
